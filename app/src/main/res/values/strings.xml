      EtherPay is an Ether wallet app. &#8212; use it to check the balance in an Ether
      account; or to send or receive Ether to/from other Ether addresses.
      \n\nTo use the app, the first thing you need to do is import an Ether account.
      You need to use some other Ether client to create an account &#8212; I recommend
      https://www.myetherwallet.com/. Even of you already have a wallet, in order
      to import it you\&apos;ll need to get the private key, which you can do at
      myetherwallet.com, (under the view wallet info tab). Once you have the private key,
      to import it into the EtherPay app select the \"import account\" menu item.
      \n\nNOTE: The EtherPay app is *not* an \"Ethereum node\"&#8212;it uses etherchain.org
      to check your Ether balance; it uses your private key to sign transactions; and it uses
      etherscan.io to broadcast signed transactions. Your private key is never transmitted.

    <string name="about">
    EtherPay is an Ether wallet app.
      \n\nI wrote it, honestly, because I love the whole concept of Ethereum, and I wanted
      to contribute in some way; and because I couldn\&apos;t find a simple Ether wallet for my
      smartphone.
      \n\nEther is usually not marketed as a currency &#8212; it is the way to pay for
      computation on the Ethereum distributed computing platform. But in my eyes this gives Ether
      an intrinsic value, in a way that is absent from other crypto-currencies. And the fact that
      Ether has intrinsic value, combined with it\&apos;s fast transaction time, 15 seconds, makes
      Ether perfect as a currency. Ulimately I believe that Ether will be widely used as a currency;
      and it\&apos;s intrinsic usability will simply ensure that it\&apos;s value cannot be zero
      (much as gold has intrinsic value, because of it\&apos;s beauty and maleablity; and therefore
      it is a natural currency).
      \n\nOne of the reasons that I would like to see the wide adoption of crypto-currencies, in
      general, and Ether in particular, is that I am a big fan of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.
      Constitution, which provides:
      \n\n\"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
      effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"
      \n\nThat is, I believe people ought to have privacy &#8212; and the anonymity of
      crypto-currencies is an important a step in that direction.
      \n\nThe EtherPay app is free; Please use it in good health! I plan to make other products
      to help people adopt Ether as a general-use currency.
      \n\nDavid Rosen, author of EtherPay.

    <string name="receive_qr_prompt">
    This QR code represents your public account address. You need to provide this address to
    any  person, in order for them to send you Ether. You can allow people to scan the address
    directly from your phone, or you can share it, using the share button below.
    \n\nNote: It generally takes about 15 seconds for an Ether transaction to affect your
    balance.

    <string name="min_sec_between_pays">
    You cannot send multiple payments in a rapid-fire sequence &#8212; To ensure that your
    payments are processed in order, please wait at least 30 seconds between consequitive
    payments.

    <string name="pay_gas_help">
    Use this field to specify the maximum gas that can be consumed by this transaction. For example,
    for a transfer to a simple Ether account I recommend a gas-limit of 35,000 GAS. Typically the
    transaction will consume less -- about 21,000 GAS... A transaction to a Contract address might
    consume much more. For example, vDice.io recommends a gas limit of 180,000 GAS in order to send
    a payment to one of their betting contracts.
    </string>
    <string name="pay_data_help">
    Use this field to attach identifting information to this payment. For example, if you are
    paying a bill at a restaurant, you might enter your table number here.
    </string>
    <string name="pay_help">
    On this screen you can make an Ether payment; that is, send Ether to the selected address.
    \n\nBefore you click the \"Pay\" button, enter the amount of Ether that you would like to send.
    You also have the option of attaching a short note to the payment. This note will be permanently
    attached to the payment, and publicly visible. For example, if you are paying a bill at a
    restaurant, you might enter your table number here.
    \n\nEach Ether transaction includes a small fee called \"gas\", which pays for the computational
    cost of executing the transaction on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Gas is not demoninated in Ether;
    to find the actual cost of a transaction in Ether, the gas is multiplied by a gas-price, which
    is set by the Ethereum nodes. (The gas price is very small, at the time of this writing
    appoximently 0.00000002 ETH/GAS).. Note that the transaction only specifies the maximum gas that can
    be consumed; any gas that is not used is not dedcuted from your account.
    \n\nThe simple Payment screen gives you the ability to send Ether to simple Ether addresses &#8212;
    and it sets the gas limit to a reasonable, conservative value. But in some cases you might want to
    send Ether to Ether Contracts, which might require much more processing. For those cases you should
    enable \"Show Gas\" in the options menu. Then you can specify the maximum gas for your transaction.
