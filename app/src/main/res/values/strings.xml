      EtherPay is an Ether wallet app. &#8212; use it to check the balance in an Ether
      account; or to send or receive Ether to/from other Ether addresses.
      \n\nTo use the app, the first thing you need to do is import an Ether account.
      You need to use some other Ether client to create an account &#8212; I recommend
      https://www.myetherwallet.com/. Even of you already have a wallet, in order
      to import it you\&apos;ll need to get the private key, which you can do at
      myetherwallet.com, (under the view wallet info tab). Once you have the private key,
      to import it into the EtherPay app select the \"import account\" menu item.
      \n\nNOTE: The EtherPay app is *not* an \"Ethereum node\"&#8212;it uses etherchain.org
      to check your Ether balance; it uses your private key to sign transactions; and it uses
      etherscan.io to broadcast signed transactions. Your private key is never transmitted.

    <string name="about">
    EtherPay is an Ether wallet app.
      \n\nI wrote it, honestly, because I love the whole concept of Ethereum, and I wanted
      to contribute in some way; and because I couldn\&apos;t find a simple Ether wallet for my
      smartphone.
      \n\nEther is usually not marketed as a currency &#8212; it is the way to pay for
      computation on the Ethereum distributed computing platform. But in my eyes this gives Ether
      an intrinsic value, in a way that is absent from other crypto-currencies. And the fact that
      Ether has intrinsic value, combined with it\&apos;s fast transaction time, 15 seconds, makes
      Ether perfect as a currency. Ulimately I believe that Ether will be widely used as a currency;
      and it\&apos;s intrinsic usability will simply ensure that it\&apos;s value cannot be zero
      (much as gold has intrinsic value, because of it\&apos;s beauty and maleablity; and therefore
      it is a natural currency).
      \n\nOne of the reasons that I would like to see the wide adoption of crypto-currencies, in
      general, and Ether in particular, is that I am a big fan of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.
      Constitution, which provides:
      \n\n\"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
      effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"
      \n\nThat is, I believe people ought to have privacy &#8212; and the anonymity of
      crypto-currencies is an important a step in that direction.
      \n\nThe EtherPay app is free; Please use it in good health! I plan to make other products
      to help people adopt Ether as a general-use currency.
      \n\nDavid Rosen, author of EtherPay.

This QR Code represents the private key to your account. You can scan the QR Code into
another smart-phone that is running EtherPay Ether wallet, or you can send it to a computer
where you are running Ether wallet software. Also you can send the key to yourself to back
it up, for example, to protect your account in case you break your phone.
\n\nImportant: Do not share your private key. If you give someone your private key
then they have access to ALL the funds in your account!

    <string name="pay_gas_help">
    Use this field to specify the maximum gas that can be consumed by this transaction. For example,
    for a transfer to a simple Ether account I recommend a gas-limit of 35,000 GAS. Typically the
    transaction will consume less -- about 21,000 GAS... A transaction to a Contract address might
    consume much more. For example, vDice.io recommends a gas limit of 180,000 GAS in order to send
    a payment to one of their betting contracts.

Sending Ether Payments
</string>
<string name="send_help">
On this screen you can make an Ether payment; that is, send Ether to the selected address.
\n\nBefore you click the \"Pay\" button, enter the amount that you would like to send. You
Can choose to denominate the amount in either ETH or Finney (one thousand\'th of an Ether).
\n\nIn the options menu you can check \"Show Data\." This will give you the ability to attach a
short note to the payment. This note will be permanently attached to the payment, and is
visible publicly. For example, if you are paying a bill at a restaurant, you might enter your
table number here.
\n\nIn the options menu you can also check \"Show GAS\." Each Ether transaction includes a small
fee called \"GAS\", which pays for the computational cost of executing the transaction on the
Ethereum Virtual Machine. Gas is not demoninated in Ether; to find the actual cost of a transaction
in Ether, the gas is multiplied by a gas-price, which is set by the Ethereum nodes. (The gas price
is very small, at the time of this writing appoximently 0.00000002 ETH/GAS).. Note that the
transaction only specifies the maximum gas that can be consumed; any gas that is not used is not
dedcuted from your account.
\n\nThe simple Payment screen gives you the ability to send Ether to simple Ether addresses &#8212;
and it sets the gas limit to a reasonable, conservative value. But in some cases you might want to
send Ether to Ether Contracts, which might require much more processing. For those cases you should
enable \"Show Gas\" in the options menu. Then you can specify the maximum gas for your transaction.

Use this field to specify the amount of Ether that you would like to send. You can

1 Finney, will be dedcuted from your account.
